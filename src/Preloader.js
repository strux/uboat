		//	You can jump right into the menu if you want and still play the music, but you'll have a few
		//	seconds of delay while the mp3 decodes - so if you need your music to be in-sync with your menu
		//	it's best to wait for it to decode here first, then carry on.
		
		//	If you don't have any music in your game then put the game.state.start line into the create function and delete
		//	the update function completely.
